Project initialized using `vite` 

Ensure you have at least Node version 20 installed.. If not install now https://nodejs.org/en/download

Once Node is installed run `npm i` at the project root to install dependencies

Once the dependencies are installed run `npm run dev` to get the dev server running.

ENJOY!!
